In this repository I am using a bank data csv and an election poll csv.

Using the bank data csv I am analyzing the company's financial records and creating a script that calculates:
  (Total number of months included in the dataset)
  (Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period)
  (Average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period)
  (Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period)
  (Greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period)
  
Using the election poll csv I am creating a script that calculates:
  (Total number of votes cast)
  (Complete list of candidates who received votes)
  (Percentage of votes each candidate won)
  -Total number of votes each candidate won
  -Winner of the election based on popular vote
